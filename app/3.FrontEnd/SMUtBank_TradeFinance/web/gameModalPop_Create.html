                                    <h4><strong>The Trade Finance Process</br></strong></h4>
                                    <p>In a trade finance process, importers and exporters first agree on a trade contract on a shipment of goods. </br>
                                    Once a deal has been reached, the Importer will establish a line of credit with his bank to finance this transaction, commonly referred to as a Letter of Credit (LC) . This will now kick start the trade finance process, which you will get to explore first hand in our trade application. </p>                
                                    </br>
                                    
                                    <h4><strong>What is a Letter of Credit?</br></strong></h4>
                                    <p>A letter of credit is a contract issued by a bank to another bank (especially one in a different country) to serve as a guarantee for payments made to a specified person under specified conditions.</p>                
                                    </br>                                    

                                    <h4><strong>Distributed Trade Finance System</br></strong></h4>
                                    <p>The Blockchain allows for all smart contracts to be created, updated and modified, by all parties on the distributed ledger (think of it as a Google Docs, for financial contracts). The Smart Contracts on the network will then be validated and enforced by the Blockchain. The trade finance system that you are using right now, is based on the Ethereum Blockchain, and all Letters of Credit on the chain are facilitated through Smart Contracts.  </p>                
                                    </br>                                           

                                    <h4><strong>What is a Smart Contract?</br></strong></h4>
                                    <p>A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. Smart contracts were first proposed by Nick Szabo, who coined the term, in 1994.</p>
