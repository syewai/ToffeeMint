                                    <p>As disruptive technological advancements such as the blockchain start to take, it becomes increasingly important that existing players in the financial industry keep their enterprise architecture agile; by using a Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) model to structure their technological stack. 
                                    </br>
                                    The tBank Trade Finance System that you are using right now is built on an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that was adopted in the mid 2000s. This banking system however still holds up, as new services (such as the Ethereum Blockchain), are integrated into the system by a middleware, and facilitated through service endpoints exposed by the ESB. This allows new services and technologies to be adopted quickly, keeping the enterprise system nimble and ready for the future. </p>
